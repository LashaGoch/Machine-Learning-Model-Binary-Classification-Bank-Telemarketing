# Machine-Learning-Model-Binary-Classification-Bank-Telemarketing
Machine Learning model to predict customers' conversion in telemarketing campaign.
Project is done in R and published in R Markdown.

## Goals & Objectives:
Our goal is to create the most accurate model that predicts whether customer subscribes a short term deposit or not.

- We will analyze data with regards to dependent variable deposit (open “yes or”no") and other independent variables.
- We will select and transform variables.
- We will compare different machine learning algorithms
- We will optimize the selected algorithms
- We will derive insights from the analysis

## Project details:
The dataset is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The data is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution.

bank-additional-full.csv with all examples (41188) and 20 inputs, ordered by date (from May 2008 to November 2010), very close to the data analyzed in 1[Moro et al., 2014]1
